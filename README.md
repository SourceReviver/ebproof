The ebproof package
===================

A LaTeX package to typeset formal proofs in the style of sequent calculus.

Presentation
------------

The `ebproof` package provides commands to typeset proof trees, in the style
of sequent calculus and related systems. The commands allow for writing
inferences with any number of premisses and alignment of successive formulas
on an arbitrary point. Various options allow complete control over spacing,
styles of inference rules, placement of labels, etc.

The distribution includes the following files:

- `ebproof.dtx` : the doctrip source for the package and documentation
- `ebproof.ins` : the generation script for producing `ebproof.sty`
- `ebproof.pdf` : the compiled documentation

The package requires `expl3` (the LaTeX3 programming environment) which
provides many useful programming tools.
