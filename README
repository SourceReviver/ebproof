The ebproofs package provides commands to typeset proof trees, in the style of
sequent calculus and related systems. The commands allow for writing
inferences with any number of premisses and alignment of successive formulas
on an arbitrary point. Various options allow complete control over spacing,
styles of inference rules, placement of labels, etc.
