== Presentation ==

The ebproofs package provides commands to typeset proof trees, in the style of
sequent calculus and related systems. The commands allow for writing
inferences with any number of premisses and alignment of successive formulas
on an arbitrary point. Various options allow complete control over spacing,
styles of inference rules, placement of labels, etc.

The distribution includes the following files:

 - ebproof.sty : the package
 - ebproof.pdf : the documentation
 - ebproof.tex : the LaTeX source for the documentation

The package requires expl3 (the LaTeX3 programming environment) whici provides
many useful programming tools.
